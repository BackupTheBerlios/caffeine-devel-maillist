Subject: [Caffeine-devel] Accessing .NET APIs from Java
Message-ID: <c83143ea0811122023tb2509b2jbfe0490cc2171507@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Caffeine Members,

While searching for some information to access .NET APIs from java I
came across this "Caffeine" - which I understand does something in the
reverse order.

I want to access the APIs in a .NET assembly or DLL file from Java code.

I found "dotnetfromjava" while googling around but  I have some
problems using that and the documentation guide to use that is not
proper and am facing huge exceptions while using that.

I would appreciate if anybody can tell me some information on this. Or
if Caffeine is able to do it.

I would also appreciate if anyone could give me any pointers to some
information on this, which can help me do it.

Thank You,
Vishal
